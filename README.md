# structural_biology

Scripts developed for structural biology. Currently more of a side/spare-time project than any other thing.

Scripts:

* **b_factor.py** - gets b-factors from PDB structures. It also calculates sequence- and space-contextÂ averages
* **centrality.py** - calculates centrality for all residues in a PDB structure
